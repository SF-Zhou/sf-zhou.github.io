# RDMA Queue Pair

### 1. State transitions

In a QP lifetime, the possible states can be:

- Reset - Default
- Initialize (Init)
- Ready To Receive (RTR)
- Ready To Send (RTS)
- Send Queue Drained (SQD)
- Send Queue Error (SQE, for Non-RC QPs)
- Error

A QP can be transitioned from one state to another state by two possible ways:

1. Explicit call to ibv_modify_qp()
2. Automatic transition by the device in case of a processing error

Any QP can be transitioned to Reset or Error state by calling ibv_modify_qp() from any state.

For error state, work Requests can be posted in both send and receive queues. If the QP was transitioned to this state automatically, the first  Work Request that completed with error will indicate the reason for the  error. All subsequent Work Requests in that queue and all Work Request  in the other queue and new Work Requests posted to both of the queues  will be flushed with error. If the QP was transitioned to this state using ibv_modify_qp() all  outstanding Work Request in both send and receive requests will be  flushed with error.

### 2. ibv_post_send

```c++
int ibv_post_send(struct ibv_qp *qp, struct ibv_send_wr *wr,
                  struct ibv_send_wr **bad_wr);
```

QP State:

1. RESET, INIT, RTR: immediate error
2. RTS: will be processed
3. ERROR: can be posted, completed with error
