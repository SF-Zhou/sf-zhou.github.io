# [Reading] Approximate nearest neighbor algorithm based on navigable small world graphs
### Abstract

> We propose a novel approach to solving the approximate k-nearest neighbor search problem in metric spaces. The search structure is based on a navigable small world graph with vertices corresponding to the stored elements, edges to links between them, and a variation of greedy algorithm for searching. The navigable small world is created simply by keeping old Delaunay graph approximation links produced at the start of construction. The approach is very universal, defined in terms of arbitrary metric spaces and at the same time it is very simple. The algorithm handles insertions in the same way as queries: by finding approximate neighbors for the inserted element and connecting it to them. Both search and insertion can be done in parallel requiring only local information from the structure. The structure can be made distributed. The accuracy of the probabilistic k-nearest neighbor queries can be adjusted without rebuilding the structure.

> The performed simulation for data in the Euclidean spaces shows that the structure built using the proposed algorithm has small world navigation properties with $\log^2(n)$ insertion and search complexity at fixed accuracy, and performs well at high dimensionality. Simulation on a CoPHiR dataset revealed its high efficiency in case of large datasets (more than an order of magnitude less metric computations at fixed recall) compared to permutation indexes. Only 0.03% of the 10 million 208-dimensional vector dataset is needed to be evaluated to achieve 0.999 recall (virtually exact search). For recall 0.93 processing speed 2800 queries/s can be achieved on a dual Intel X5675 Xenon server node with Java implementation.

### Core idea

The k-nearest neighbor search (k-NNS) problem is defined as follows: we need to find the set of $k$ closest objects $P \subseteq X$ from a finite set of objects $X \subseteq \mathcal D$ to a given query $q \in \mathcal D$, where $\mathcal D$ is the set of all possible objects (the data domain). Closeness or proximity of two objects $a, b \in \mathcal D$ is defined as a distance function $\delta (a, b)$.

The structure $S$ is constructed as a navigable small world network represented by a graph $G(V , E)$, where objects from the set $X$ are uniquely mapped to vertices from the set $V$.

### Search algorithm

**Basic greedy search algorithm**: Starting from the entry point, the algorithm computes a distance from the query q to each vertex from the friend list of the current vertex, and then selects a vertex with the minimal distance. If the distance between the query and the selected vertex is smaller than the one between the query and the current element, then the algorithm moves to the selected vertex, and it becomes new current vertex. The algorithm stops when it reaches a local minimum: a vertex whose friend list does not contain a vertex that is closer to the query than the vertex itself.

If every element in the structure had in their friend list all of its Voronoi neighbors, then this would preclude the existence of false global minima. It turns out that it is impossible to determine exact Delaunay graph for an unknown metric space, so we cannot avoid the existence of false global minima.

**k-NN search modification**:

1. We use different stop condition. It stops when at the next iteration, $k$ closest results to the query do not change.
2. The list of previously visited elements visitedSet is shared across the series of searches preventing useless repeated extractions. 

### Insertion algorithm

```python
def nearest_neighbor_insert(new_object, w, f):
    neighbors = knn_search(new_object, w, f)
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        neighbor.connect(new_object)
        new_object.connect(neighbor)
```
